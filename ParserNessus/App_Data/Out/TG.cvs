The remote Telnet server transmits traffic in cleartext.;The remote host is running a Telnet server over an unencrypted channel.  Using Telnet over an unencrypted channel is not recommended as logins, passwords, and commands are transferred in cleartext. This allows a remote, man-in-the-middle attacker to eavesdrop on a Telnet session to obtain credentials or other sensitive information and to modify traffic exchanged between a client and server.  SSH is preferred over Telnet since it protects credentials from eavesdropping and can tunnel additional data streams such as an X11 session.;Disable the Telnet service and use SSH instead.;10.1.4.253;23;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;Unencrypted Telnet Server;;;;AIX 4.3.2 AIX 5.2 CatalystOS 6.3 VAX/VMS 7.1;

The remote host supports a set of weak ciphers.;The remote host supports EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less than or equal to 512 bits. An attacker can factor a 512-bit RSA modulus in a short amount of time.  A man-in-the middle attacker may be able to downgrade the session to use EXPORT_RSA cipher suites (e.g. CVE-2015-0204). Thus, it is recommended to remove support for weak cipher suites.;Reconfigure the service to remove support for EXPORT_RSA cipher suites.;10.1.4.195;443;;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2015-0204;71936;4.1;SSL/TLS EXPORT_RSA &lt.= 512-bit Cipher Suites Supported (FREAK);https://www.smacktls.com/#freak https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20150108.txt http://www.nessus.org/u?b78da2c4;OSVDB:116794 CERT:243585;;Dell PowerConnect Switch;

The remote service supports the use of the RC4 cipher.;The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites. The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into the stream, decreasing its randomness.  If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted (e.g., HTTP cookies), and an attacker is able to obtain many (i.e., tens of millions) ciphertexts, the attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.;Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of RC4 ciphers.

The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.   Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end in a certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an unrecognized certificate authority.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.4.195;443;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Self-Signed Certificate;;;;Dell PowerConnect Switch;
The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.4.195;443;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;;Dell PowerConnect Switch;

The remote Telnet server transmits traffic in cleartext.;The remote host is running a Telnet server over an unencrypted channel.  Using Telnet over an unencrypted channel is not recommended as logins, passwords, and commands are transferred in cleartext. This allows a remote, man-in-the-middle attacker to eavesdrop on a Telnet session to obtain credentials or other sensitive information and to modify traffic exchanged between a client and server.

An SSL certificate in the certificate chain has been signed using a weak hash algorithm.;The remote service uses an SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g. MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. An attacker can exploit this to generate another certificate with the same digital signature, allowing an attacker to masquerade as the affected service.  Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google&apos.s gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.  Note that certificates in the chain that are contained in the Nessus CA database have been ignored.;Contact the Certificate Authority to have the certificate reissued.;10.1.4.180;443;;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2004-2761;11849 33065;3.5;SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279 http://www.phreedom.org/research/rogue-ca/ http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/961509;OSVDB:45106 OSVDB:45108 OSVDB:45127 CERT:836068 CWE:310;9e:cc:51:71:02:81 c6:8f:a4:07:70:ed 96:cb:f9:0c:82:3e 62:e4:71:a8:db:3e c4:01:7c:09:3f:60 c4:01:7c:09:3f:63 c4:01:7c:09:3f:6c c4:01:7c:09:3f:65 c4:01:7c:09:3f:61 0e:27:54:28:14:65 c4:01:7c:09:3f:64 c4:01:7c:09:3f:68 16:18:e9:89:15:e1 42:c0:4b:36:0a:4b;EPSON Stylus Printer Linksys Wireless Access Point Oracle Integrated Lights Out Manager;
The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.4.180;443;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;9e:cc:51:71:02:81 c6:8f:a4:07:70:ed 96:cb:f9:0c:82:3e 62:e4:71:a8:db:3e c4:01:7c:09:3f:60 c4:01:7c:09:3f:63 c4:01:7c:09:3f:6c c4:01:7c:09:3f:65 c4:01:7c:09:3f:61 0e:27:54:28:14:65 c4:01:7c:09:3f:64 c4:01:7c:09:3f:68 16:18:e9:89:15:e1 42:c0:4b:36:0a:4b;EPSON Stylus Printer Linksys Wireless Access Point Oracle Integrated Lights Out Manager;

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.;10.1.4.148;443;;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2014-3566;70574;3.7;SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE);https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00;OSVDB:113251 CERT:577193;;CISCO IOS 12.0;

The X.509 certificate chain used by this service contains certificates with RSA keys shorter than 2048 bits.;At least one of the X.509 certificates sent by the remote host has a key that is shorter than 2048 bits. According to industry standards set by the Certification Authority/Browser (CA/B) Forum, certificates issued after January 1, 2014 must be at least 2048 bits.  Some browser SSL implementations may reject keys less than 2048 bits after January 1, 2014. Additionally, some SSL certificate vendors may revoke certificates less than 2048 bits before January 1, 2014.  Note that Nessus will not flag root certificates with RSA keys less than 2048 bits if they were issued prior to December 31, 2010, as the standard considers them exempt.;Replace the certificate in the chain with the RSA key less than 2048 bits in length with a longer key, and reissue any certificates signed by the old certificate.;10.1.4.148;443;;tcp;Low;False;;;;SSL Certificate Chain Contains RSA Keys Less Than 2048 bits;https://www.cabforum.org/Baseline_Requirements_V1.pdf;;;CISCO IOS 12.0;
The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.4.148;443;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;;CISCO IOS 12.0;

The remote Telnet server transmits traffic in cleartext.;The remote host is running a Telnet server over an unencrypted channel.  Using Telnet over an unencrypted channel is not recommended as logins, passwords, and commands are transferred in cleartext. This allows a remote, man-in-the-middle attacker to eavesdrop on a Telnet session to obtain credentials or other sensitive information and to modify traffic exchanged between a client and server.  SSH is preferred over Telnet since it protects credentials from eavesdropping and can tunnel additional data streams such as an X11 session.;Disable the Telnet service and use SSH instead.;10.1.4.148;23;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;Unencrypted Telnet Server;;;;CISCO IOS 12.0;

The X.509 certificate chain used by this service contains certificates with RSA keys shorter than 2048 bits.;At least one of the X.509 certificates sent by the remote host has a key that is shorter than 2048 bits. According to industry standards set by the Certification Authority/Browser (CA/B) Forum, certificates issued after January 1, 2014 must be at least 2048 bits.  Some browser SSL implementations may reject keys less than 2048 bits after January 1, 2014. Additionally, some SSL certificate vendors may revoke certificates less than 2048 bits before January 1, 2014.  Note that Nessus will not flag root certificates with RSA keys less than 2048 bits if they were issued prior to December 31, 2010, as the standard considers them exempt.;Replace the certificate in the chain with the RSA key less than 2048 bits in length with a longer key, and reissue any certificates signed by the old certificate.;10.1.4.147;443;;tcp;Low;False;;;;SSL Certificate Chain Contains RSA Keys Less Than 2048 bits;https://www.cabforum.org/Baseline_Requirements_V1.pdf;;;CISCO IOS 12.0;
The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.;10.1.4.144;443;;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2014-3566;70574;3.7;SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE);https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00;OSVDB:113251 CERT:577193;;HP Switch;

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.4.143;443;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;2c:23:3a:6f:d5:ff 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:38 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:10 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:2c 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:27 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:24 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:2e 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:20 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:23 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:1f 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:37 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:21 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:19 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:3b 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:39 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:2b 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:34 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:22 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:2a 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:0e 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:16 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:15 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:33 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:31 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:40 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:2f 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:0d 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:3a 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:30 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:17 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:11 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:3f 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:28 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:25 00:00:00:00:00:00 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:36 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:29 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:13 2c:23:3a:6f:d5:ee 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:12 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:18 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:1a 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:3e 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:3c 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:26 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:2d 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:1b 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:0f 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:14 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:1d 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:1e 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:3d 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:35 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:1c 2c:23:3a:6f:d6:32;Microsoft Windows Vista;

The remote service supports the use of the RC4 cipher.;The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites. The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into the stream, decreasing its randomness.  If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted (e.g., HTTP cookies), and an attacker is able to obtain many (i.e., tens of millions) ciphertexts, the attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.;Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of RC4 ciphers.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.4.141;443;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;2c:23:3a:65:43:d9 2c:23:3a:65:43:b1 2c:23:3a:65:43:ce 2c:23:3a:65:43:bd 2c:23:3a:65:43:bc 2c:23:3a:65:43:cd 2c:23:3a:65:43:d0 2c:23:3a:65:43:b0 2c:23:3a:65:43:b6 2c:23:3a:65:43:bb 2c:23:3a:65:43:d3 2c:23:3a:65:43:b7 2c:23:3a:65:43:c4 2c:23:3a:65:43:c7 2c:23:3a:65:43:da 2c:23:3a:65:43:c5 2c:23:3a:65:43:8c 2c:23:3a:65:43:b3 2c:23:3a:65:43:be 2c:23:3a:65:43:af 2c:23:3a:65:43:b9 2c:23:3a:65:43:ab 2c:23:3a:65:43:c1 2c:23:3a:65:43:9d 2c:23:3a:65:43:d8 2c:23:3a:65:43:d2 00:00:00:00:00:00 2c:23:3a:65:43:ae 2c:23:3a:65:43:c2 2c:23:3a:65:43:c6 2c:23:3a:65:43:d6 2c:23:3a:65:43:c3 2c:23:3a:65:43:ba 2c:23:3a:65:43:b2 2c:23:3a:65:43:cb 2c:23:3a:65:43:b4 2c:23:3a:65:43:d7 2c:23:3a:65:43:d4 2c:23:3a:65:43:cc 2c:23:3a:65:43:dc 2c:23:3a:65:43:d5 2c:23:3a:65:43:d1 2c:23:3a:65:43:c0 2c:23:3a:65:43:c8 2c:23:3a:65:43:ad 2c:23:3a:65:43:ac 2c:23:3a:65:43:dd 2c:23:3a:65:43:cf 2c:23:3a:65:43:c9 2c:23:3a:65:43:b5 2c:23:3a:65:43:de 2c:23:3a:65:43:db 2c:23:3a:65:43:ca 2c:23:3a:65:43:b8 2c:23:3a:65:43:bf;Microsoft Windows Vista;

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.4.140;443;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;2c:23:3a:0f:9c:6d 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:73 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:7b 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:8a 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:5b 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:91 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:8e 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:7e 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:7d 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:6c 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:9c 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:99 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:93 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:88 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:85 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:71 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:9a 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:8d 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:89 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:7a 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:6e 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:86 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:6b 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:7f 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:74 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:95 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:90 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:75 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:6a 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:94 00:00:00:00:00:00 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:8c 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:80 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:7c 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:70 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:8f 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:82 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:9b 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:98 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:96 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:78 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:84 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:4a 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:8b 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:76 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:81 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:72 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:87 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:97 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:77 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:83 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:79 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:92 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:69 2c:23:3a:0f:9c:6f;Microsoft Windows Vista;

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.;10.1.4.138;443;;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2014-3566;70574;3.7;SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE);https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00;OSVDB:113251 CERT:577193;;CISCO IOS 12.0;

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE.

The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.   Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end in a certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an unrecognized certificate authority.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.4.98;443;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Self-Signed Certificate;;;;AIX 4.3.2 AIX 5.2 CatalystOS 6.3 VAX/VMS 7.1;
The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.4.98;443;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;;AIX 4.3.2 AIX 5.2 CatalystOS 6.3 VAX/VMS 7.1;

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.

Additionally, some SSL certificate vendors may revoke certificates less than 2048 bits before January 1, 2014.  Note that Nessus will not flag root certificates with RSA keys less than 2048 bits if they were issued prior to December 31, 2010, as the standard considers them exempt.;Replace the certificate in the chain with the RSA key less than 2048 bits in length with a longer key, and reissue any certificates signed by the old certificate.;10.1.3.27;443;;tcp;Low;False;;;;SSL Certificate Chain Contains RSA Keys Less Than 2048 bits;https://www.cabforum.org/Baseline_Requirements_V1.pdf;;;Linux Kernel 3.10 Linux Kernel 3.5 Linux Kernel 3.8 Linux Kernel 3.9;

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.;10.1.3.1;443;;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2014-3566;70574;3.7;SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE);https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00;OSVDB:113251 CERT:577193;;HP Switch;

This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.

An SSL certificate in the certificate chain has been signed using a weak hash algorithm.;The remote service uses an SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g. MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1).

The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.2.111;465;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;;Linux Kernel 2.6 on CentOS Linux release 6;

An SSL certificate in the certificate chain has been signed using a weak hash algorithm.;The remote service uses an SSL certificate chain that has been signed using a cryptographically weak hashing algorithm (e.g. MD2, MD4, MD5, or SHA1). These signature algorithms are known to be vulnerable to collision attacks. An attacker can exploit this to generate another certificate with the same digital signature, allowing an attacker to masquerade as the affected service.  Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google&apos.s gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.2.110;465;DEVBDWEBLINCEN;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;;Linux Kernel 2.6 on CentOS Linux release 6;

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

It may be possible to get access to the remote host.;The remote version of the Remote Desktop Protocol Server (Terminal Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.  This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.; Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and  - Select the &apos.Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication&apos. setting if it is available.;10.1.2.107;3389;LASERFICHE;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2005-1794;13818;4.6;Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Server Man-in-the-Middle Weakness;http://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf http://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096 http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx;OSVDB:17131;00:50:56:84:24:b0;Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Standard;

NLA uses the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol to perform strong server authentication either through TLS/SSL or Kerberos mechanisms, which protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. In addition to improving authentication, NLA also helps protect the remote computer from malicious users and software by completing user authentication before a full RDP connection is established.;Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA) on the remote RDP server.

The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.   Note that this plugin does not check for certificate chains that end in a certificate that is not self-signed, but is signed by an unrecognized certificate authority.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.2.107;3389;LASERFICHE;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Self-Signed Certificate;;;00:50:56:84:24:b0;Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Standard;
The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.

Some browser SSL implementations may reject keys less than 2048 bits after January 1, 2014. Additionally, some SSL certificate vendors may revoke certificates less than 2048 bits before January 1, 2014.  Note that Nessus will not flag root certificates with RSA keys less than 2048 bits if they were issued prior to December 31, 2010, as the standard considers them exempt.;Replace the certificate in the chain with the RSA key less than 2048 bits in length with a longer key, and reissue any certificates signed by the old certificate.;10.1.2.100;1433;SOLMAN;tcp;Low;False;;;;SSL Certificate Chain Contains RSA Keys Less Than 2048 bits;https://www.cabforum.org/Baseline_Requirements_V1.pdf;;00:50:56:84:3f:70;Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Service Pack 1;

It may be possible to get access to the remote host.;The remote version of the Remote Desktop Protocol Server (Terminal Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.  This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.; Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and  - Select the &apos.Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication&apos. setting if it is available.;10.1.2.91;3389;SPICEWORKS;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2005-1794;13818;4.6;Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Server Man-in-the-Middle Weakness;http://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf http://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096 http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx;OSVDB:17131;00:50:56:84:e5:76;Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Standard;

The remote Apache Tomcat server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.;According to its self-reported version number, the Apache Tomcat service listening on the remote host is 7.0.x prior to 7.0.60. It is, therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when the SSLv3     option isn&apos.t enabled and an SSLv3 ClientHello is     received. This allows a remote attacker, using an     unexpected handshake, to crash the daemon, resulting in     a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3569)    - The BIGNUM squaring (BN_sqr) implementation does not     properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value. This     allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic     protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-3570)    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists with     dtls1_get_record() when handling DTLS messages. A remote     attacker, using a specially crafted DTLS message, can     cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)    - A flaw exists with ECDH handshakes when using an ECDSA     certificate without a ServerKeyExchange message. This     allows a remote attacker to trigger a loss of forward     secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)    - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of     certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings     due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed     and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including     crafted data within a certificate&apos.s unsigned portion,     can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist     protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)    - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK     (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the     support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less     than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker     may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use     EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a     short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept     and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)    - A flaw exists when accepting DH certificates for client     authentication without the CertificateVerify message.     This allows a remote attacker to authenticate to the     service without a private key. (CVE-2015-0205)    - A memory leak occurs in dtls1_buffer_record()     when handling a saturation of DTLS records containing     the same number sequence but for the next epoch. This     allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.

(CVE-2015-0287)    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the     X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing     of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via     a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of     service. (CVE-2015-0288)    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7     parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer     ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an     application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and     providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause     a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0289)    - A flaw exists in servers that both support SSLv2 and     enable export cipher suites due to improper     implementation of SSLv2.

The remote Apache Tomcat server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.;According to its self-reported version number, the Apache Tomcat service listening on the remote host is 7.0.x prior to 7.0.60. It is, therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists when the SSLv3     option isn&apos.t enabled and an SSLv3 ClientHello is     received. This allows a remote attacker, using an     unexpected handshake, to crash the daemon, resulting in     a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3569)    - The BIGNUM squaring (BN_sqr) implementation does not     properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value. This     allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic     protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-3570)    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists with     dtls1_get_record() when handling DTLS messages. A remote     attacker, using a specially crafted DTLS message, can     cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)    - A flaw exists with ECDH handshakes when using an ECDSA     certificate without a ServerKeyExchange message. This     allows a remote attacker to trigger a loss of forward     secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)    - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of     certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings     due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed     and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including     crafted data within a certificate&apos.s unsigned portion,     can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist     protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)    - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK     (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the     support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less     than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker     may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use     EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a     short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept     and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)    - A flaw exists when accepting DH certificates for client     authentication without the CertificateVerify message.     This allows a remote attacker to authenticate to the     service without a private key. (CVE-2015-0205)    - A memory leak occurs in dtls1_buffer_record()     when handling a saturation of DTLS records containing     the same number sequence but for the next epoch. This     allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.     (CVE-2015-0206)    - A use-after-free condition exists in the     d2i_ECPrivateKey() function due to improper processing     of malformed EC private key files during import. A     remote attacker can exploit this to dereference or free     already freed memory, resulting in a denial of service     or other unspecified impact. (CVE-2015-0209)    - An invalid read flaw exists in the ASN1_TYPE_cmp()     function due to improperly performed boolean-type     comparisons. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a     crafted X.509 certificate to an endpoint that uses the     certificate-verification feature, to cause an invalid     read operation, resulting in a denial of service.     (CVE-2015-0286)    - A flaw exists in the ASN1_item_ex_d2i() function due to     a failure to reinitialize &apos.CHOICE&apos. and &apos.ADB&apos. data     structures when reusing a structure in ASN.1 parsing.     This allows a remote attacker to cause an invalid write     operation and memory corruption, resulting in a denial     of service. (CVE-2015-0287)    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the     X509_to_X509_REQ() function due to improper processing     of certificate keys. This allows a remote attacker, via     a crafted X.509 certificate, to cause a denial of     service. (CVE-2015-0288)    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7     parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing outer     ContentInfo. This allows a remote attacker, using an     application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and     providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, to cause     a denial of service.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.

The remote service is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.;According to its banner, the remote host is running a version of OpenSSL 1.0.2 prior to 1.0.2g. It is, therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :    - A key disclosure vulnerability exists due to improper     handling of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel     Sandy-bridge microarchitecture. An attacker can exploit     this to gain access to RSA key information.     (CVE-2016-0702)    - A double-free error exists due to improper validation of     user-supplied input when parsing malformed DSA private     keys. A remote attacker can exploit this to corrupt     memory, resulting in a denial of service condition or     the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0705)    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the     BN_hex2bn() and BN_dec2bn() functions. A remote attacker     can exploit this to trigger a heap corruption, resulting     in the execution of arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0797)    - A denial of service vulnerability exists due to improper     handling of invalid usernames. A remote attacker can     exploit this, via a specially crafted username, to leak     300 bytes of memory per connection, exhausting available     memory resources.

These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic flaws. An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and clients.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.;10.1.2.81;443;DOMIER;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2014-3566;70574;3.7;SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE);https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00;OSVDB:113251 CERT:577193;;Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard;

An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.2.71;993;;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;;Linux Kernel 2.6 on CentOS release 5;

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.;10.1.2.57;995;;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2014-3566;70574;3.7;SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE);https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00;OSVDB:113251 CERT:577193;;Linux Kernel 3.10 on CentOS Linux release 7;

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

The remote host is affected by a vulnerability that could allow sensitive data to be decrypted.;The OpenSSL service on the remote host is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, based on its acceptance of a specially crafted handshake.  This flaw could allow a MiTM attacker to decrypt or forge SSL messages by telling the service to begin encrypted communications before key material has been exchanged, which causes predictable keys to be used to secure future traffic.  Note that Nessus has only tested for an SSL/TLS MiTM vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224). However, Nessus has inferred that the OpenSSL service on the remote host is also affected by six additional vulnerabilities that were disclosed in OpenSSL&apos.s June 5th, 2014 security advisory :    - An error exists in the &apos.ssl3_read_bytes&apos. function     that permits data to be injected into other sessions     or allows denial of service attacks. Note that this     issue is exploitable only if SSL_MODE_RELEASE_BUFFERS     is enabled. (CVE-2010-5298)    - An error exists related to the implementation of the     Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) that     allows nonce disclosure via the &apos.FLUSH+RELOAD&apos. cache     side-channel attack. (CVE-2014-0076)    - A buffer overflow error exists related to invalid DTLS     fragment handling that permits the execution of     arbitrary code or allows denial of service attacks.     Note that this issue only affects OpenSSL when used     as a DTLS client or server. (CVE-2014-0195)    - An error exists in the &apos.do_ssl3_write&apos. function that     permits a NULL pointer to be dereferenced, which could     allow denial of service attacks.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism.

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.  This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.

The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.2.44;5222;JUNQUERS;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;;Linux Kernel 3.0 on Ubuntu 12.04 (precise);

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.;10.1.2.37;1433;SAPPRDSERV;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2014-3566;70574;3.7;SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE);https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00;OSVDB:113251 CERT:577193;00:50:56:84:c4:6e;Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Service Pack 1;

It may be possible to get access to the remote host.;The remote version of the Remote Desktop Protocol Server (Terminal Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.  This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.

An attacker can exploit this to generate another certificate with the same digital signature, allowing an attacker to masquerade as the affected service.  Note that this plugin reports all SSL certificate chains signed with SHA-1 that expire after January 1, 2017 as vulnerable. This is in accordance with Google&apos.s gradual sunsetting of the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

The remote web server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.;According to the web server&apos.s banner, the version of HP System Management Homepage (SMH) hosted on the remote web server is prior to 7.2.5 or 7.4.1. It is, therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :    - An information disclosure vulnerability exists exists in     OpenSSL due to the pretty printing functions leaking     information from the stack. A remote attacker can     exploit this to disclose sensitive information that is     echoed from pretty printing output. (CVE-2014-3508)    - A race condition exists in OpenSSL that is triggered     when handling Elliptic Curve (EC) Point Format Extension     data in a resumed session. A remote attacker can exploit     this to corrupt memory, resulting in a denial of service     condition or the execution of arbitrary code.     (CVE-2014-3509)    - A flaw exists in OpenSSL related to handling fragmented     &apos.ClientHello&apos. messages that allows a man-in-the-middle     attacker to force usage of TLS 1.0 regardless of higher     protocol levels being supported by both the server and     the client. (CVE-2014-3511)    - A denial of service vulnerability exists in OpenSSL in     the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code due to improper     handling of handshake messages. A remote attacker can     exploit this, via a specially crafted handshake message,     to cause a memory leak, resulting in a denial of     service. (CVE-2014-3513)    - A man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure     vulnerability, known as POODLE, exists due to the way     SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages     encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining     (CBC) mode. A MitM attacker can decrypt a selected byte     of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able     to force a victim application to repeatedly send the     same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.     (CVE-2014-3566)    - A denial of service vulnerability exists in OpenSSL due     to a failure to properly verify the integrity of session     tickets. A remote attacker can exploit this, via a large     number of invalid session tickets, to cause a memory     leak, resulting in a denial of service condition.     (CVE-2014-3567)    - An error exists in OpenSSL related to the build     configuration process and the &apos.no-ssl3&apos. build option     that allows servers and clients to process insecure SSL     3.0 handshake messages. (CVE-2014-3568)    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in OpenSSL that     is triggered when an SRP ciphersuite is specified     without being properly negotiated with the client. A     remote attacker controlling a malicious server can     exploit this to crash an OpenSSL client. (CVE-2014-3569)    - A remote code execution vulnerability exists due to a     buffer overflow condition in the Single Sign On (SSO)     module. A remote attacker, using a long parameter, can     exploit this to execute arbitrary code in the context of     SYSTEM.

The remote web server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.;According to the web server&apos.s banner, the version of HP System Management Homepage (SMH) hosted on the remote web server is a version prior to 7.5.4. It is, therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :    - A denial of service vulnerability exists when processing     an ECParameters structure due to an infinite loop that     occurs when a specified curve is over a malformed binary     polynomial field. A remote attacker can exploit this to     perform a denial of service against any system that     processes public keys, certificate requests, or     certificates. This includes TLS clients and TLS servers     with client authentication enabled. (CVE-2015-1788)     - A denial of service vulnerability exists due to improper     validation of the content and length of the ASN1_TIME     string by the X509_cmp_time() function. A remote     attacker can exploit this, via a malformed certificate     and CRLs of various sizes, to cause a segmentation     fault, resulting in a denial of service condition. TLS     clients that verify CRLs are affected. TLS clients and     servers with client authentication enabled may be     affected if they use custom verification callbacks.     (CVE-2015-1789)    - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the PKCS#7     parsing code due to incorrect handling of missing inner     &apos.EncryptedContent&apos.. This allows a remote attacker, via     specially crafted ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs with     missing content, to cause a denial of service condition     or other potential unspecified impacts. (CVE-2015-1790)    - A double-free error exists due to a race condition that     occurs when a NewSessionTicket is received by a     multi-threaded client when attempting to reuse a     previous ticket. (CVE-2015-1791)    - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the CMS code     due to an infinite loop that occurs when verifying a     signedData message. A remote attacker can exploit this     to cause a denial of service condition. (CVE-2015-1792)    - A certificate validation bypass vulnerability exists in     the Security:Encryption subcomponent due to a flaw in     the X509_verify_cert() function in x509_vfy.c that is     triggered when locating alternate certificate chains     when the first attempt to build such a chain fails. A     remote attacker can exploit this, by using a valid leaf     certificate as a certificate authority (CA), to issue     invalid certificates that will bypass authentication.     (CVE-2015-1793)    - A cross-request authentication bypass vulnerability     exists in libcurl due to the use of an existing,     authenticated connection when performing a subsequent     unauthenticated NTLM HTTP request. An attacker can     exploit this to bypass authentication mechanisms.     (CVE-2015-3143)    - A denial of service vulnerability exists in libcurl due     to a flaw in the sanitize_cookie_path() function that is     triggered when handling a cookie path element that     consists of a single double-quote. An attacker can     exploit this to cause the application to crash.     (CVE-2015-3145)    - A cross-request authentication bypass vulnerability     exists in libcurl due to a flaw that is triggered when a     request is &apos.Negotiate&apos. authenticated, which can cause     the program to treat the entire connection as     authenticated rather than just that specific request. An     attacker can exploit this to bypass authentication     mechanisms for subsequent requests. (CVE-2015-3148)    - A man-in-the-middle vulnerability, known as Logjam,     exists due to a flaw in the SSL/TLS protocol. A remote     attacker can exploit this flaw to downgrade connections     using ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange to 512-bit     export-grade cryptography. (CVE-2015-4000)    - A flaw exists in the multipart_buffer_headers() function     in rfc1867.c due to improper handling of     multipart/form-data in HTTP requests. A remote attacker     can exploit this flaw to cause a consumption of CPU     resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.     (CVE-2015-4024)    - An unspecified flaw exists that allows an authenticated,     remote attacker to impact confidentiality and integrity.     (CVE-2016-1993)    - An unspecified information disclosure vulnerability     exists that allows an authenticated, remote attacker to     gain unauthorized access to information. (CVE-2016-1994)    - An unspecified remote code execution vulnerability     exists that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker     to take complete control of the system.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.

The remote web server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities.;According to the web server&apos.s banner, the version of HP System Management Homepage (SMH) hosted on the remote web server is a version prior to 7.2.1.0. It is, therefore, affected by the following vulnerabilities :    - An information disclosure vulnerability, known as BEAST,     exists in the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols due to a     flaw in the way the initialization vector (IV) is     selected when operating in cipher-block chaining (CBC)     modes. A man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this     to obtain plaintext HTTP header data, by using a     blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS     session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses     the HTML5 WebSocket API, the Java URLConnection API,     or the Silverlight WebClient API. (CVE-2011-3389)    - The utility &apos.apachectl&apos. can receive a zero-length     directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH via the &apos.envvars&apos.     file. A local attacker with access to that utility     could exploit this to load a malicious Dynamic Shared     Object (DSO), leading to arbitrary code execution.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.;10.1.2.27;54524;SQLCLUDTC;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2014-3566;70574;3.7;SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE);https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00;OSVDB:113251 CERT:577193;00:50:56:84:98:03;Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Standard;

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.

The remote host is affected by a vulnerability that could allow sensitive data to be decrypted.;The OpenSSL service on the remote host is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, based on its acceptance of a specially crafted handshake.  This flaw could allow a MiTM attacker to decrypt or forge SSL messages by telling the service to begin encrypted communications before key material has been exchanged, which causes predictable keys to be used to secure future traffic.  Note that Nessus has only tested for an SSL/TLS MiTM vulnerability (CVE-2014-0224). However, Nessus has inferred that the OpenSSL service on the remote host is also affected by six additional vulnerabilities that were disclosed in OpenSSL&apos.s June 5th, 2014 security advisory :    - An error exists in the &apos.ssl3_read_bytes&apos. function     that permits data to be injected into other sessions     or allows denial of service attacks.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.

The remote service supports the use of the RC4 cipher.;The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites. The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into the stream, decreasing its randomness.  If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted (e.g., HTTP cookies), and an attacker is able to obtain many (i.e., tens of millions) ciphertexts, the attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.;Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of RC4 ciphers.

The SSL certificate chain for this service ends in an unrecognized self-signed certificate.;The X.509 certificate chain for this service is not signed by a recognized certificate authority.  If the remote host is a public host in production, this nullifies the use of SSL as anyone could establish a man-in-the-middle attack against the remote host.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.;Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.;10.1.2.17;3389;OSPREY;tcp;Medium;False;;;;SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted;;;00:50:56:84:01:20;Microsoft Windows Server 2012 Standard;

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.

The remote DNS server is vulnerable to cache snooping attacks.;The remote DNS server responds to queries for third-party domains that do not have the recursion bit set.   This may allow a remote attacker to determine which domains have recently been resolved via this name server, and therefore which hosts have been recently visited.   For instance, if an attacker was interested in whether your company utilizes the online services of a particular financial institution, they would be able to use this attack to build a statistical model regarding company usage of that financial institution.  Of course, the attack can also be used to find B2B partners, web-surfing patterns, external mail servers, and more.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.  Services that must support SSLv3 should enable the TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism until SSLv3 can be disabled.;10.1.2.1;443;;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2014-3566;70574;3.7;SSLv3 Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption Vulnerability (POODLE);https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html https://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00;OSVDB:113251 CERT:577193;;HP Switch;
