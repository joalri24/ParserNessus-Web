The remote service supports the use of the RC4 cipher.;The remote host supports the use of RC4 in one or more cipher suites. The RC4 cipher is flawed in its generation of a pseudo-random stream of bytes so that a wide variety of small biases are introduced into the stream, decreasing its randomness.  If plaintext is repeatedly encrypted (e.g., HTTP cookies), and an attacker is able to obtain many (i.e., tens of millions) ciphertexts, the attacker may be able to derive the plaintext.;Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of RC4 ciphers.

It may be possible to get access to the remote host.;The remote version of the Remote Desktop Protocol Server (Terminal Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.  This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.; Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and  - Select the &apos.Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication&apos. setting if it is available.;172.17.7.11;3389;RAGEGUY;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2005-1794;13818;4.6;Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Server Man-in-the-Middle Weakness;http://www.oxid.it/downloads/rdp-gbu.pdf http://www.nessus.org/u?e2628096 http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc782610.aspx;OSVDB:17131;00:0c:29:71:87:10;Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Service Pack 1;

The remote Terminal Services doesn&apos.t use Network Level Authentication only.;The remote Terminal Services is not configured to use Network Level Authentication (NLA) only. NLA uses the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol to perform strong server authentication either through TLS/SSL or Kerberos mechanisms, which protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. In addition to improving authentication, NLA also helps protect the remote computer from malicious users and software by completing user authentication before a full RDP connection is established.;Enable Network Level Authentication (NLA) on the remote RDP server.

A man-in-the-middle attacker able to intercept communications between a client and a server hosting a SAM database can exploit this to force the authentication level to downgrade, allowing the attacker to impersonate an authenticated user and access the SAM database.;Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows Vista, 2008, 7, 2008 R2, 2012, 8.1, RT 8.1, 2012 R2, and 10.;172.17.7.11;1027;RAGEGUY;tcp;Medium;True;CVE-2016-0128;86002;5.6;MS16-047: Security Update for SAM and LSAD Remote Protocols (3148527) (Badlock) (uncredentialed check);https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS16-047 http://badlock.org/;OSVDB:136339 MSFT:MS16-047 CERT:813296 IAVA:2016-A-0093;00:0c:29:71:87:10;Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Service Pack 1;

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.

It is possible to obtain sensitive information from the remote host with SSL/TLS-enabled services.;The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.  As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be &apos.rolled back&apos. to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.  The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents &apos.version rollback&apos. attacks without impacting legacy clients. however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.  This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to completely mitigate the vulnerability.;Disable SSLv3.

The SSL certificate for this service cannot be trusted.;The server&apos.s X.509 certificate does not have a signature from a known public certificate authority.  This situation can occur in three different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below which certificates cannot be trusted.   First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate authority.   Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan occurs before one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notBefore&apos. dates, or after one of the certificate&apos.s &apos.notAfter&apos. dates.   Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either didn&apos.t match the certificate&apos.s information, or could not be verified.  Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that could not be verified are the result of the certificate&apos.s issuer using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not recognize.   If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server.
